  <h3>Household Income (weekly)</h3> 
  <br>
  <h4>Continuing on from the information provided from the <a href="page1.html">Language Map</a>, there seems to be a divide in where people lived based on the languages they spoke, this was the supposed imaginary latte line. Using the another dataset which contains data on the weekly income of households we are able to see this divide again. In the map displayed below the colours show the intensity of households that have a weekly income of over $4000, while the extrusions show the intensity of households with a weekly income of $650-$799.
  <br>
  <br>
      The brighter the colours are on the map the more households there are in that are with a weekly income of over $4000. And the higher the extrusions are on the map the more households there are in that area with a weekly income of $650-$799.
