  <h3>Languages Spoken VS Household Income</h3> 
  <br>
  <br>
  <h4>Based on the previous analysis of the <a href="page2.html">weekly household income</a>and the<a href="page1.html">languages spoken</a>it is clear that there is a direct coreelation between the two. In the languages analysis people who spoke english only after moving to NSW from overseas would live in Eastern and North-Eastern Sydney, and the households with a weekly income of over $4000 would live in Eastern and North-Eastern Sydney aswell. This suggests that people were either already accomplished in their careers from overseas and moved to NSW looking for an nice neighbourhood to live in (hence Eastern and North-Eastern Sydney), or that people that speak English are more favoured when it comes to finding a good paying job in Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
    On the other hand, people that spoke another language, but did not speak english at all or well would live in Western and South-Western Sydney, and that households with a weekly income of $650-$799 would also live in Western and South-Western Sydney. The implications of this is that people that moved from overseas to NSW that are not good at english would earn less money that that of those who did speak English.

  <h4>All of this analysis of data can have many conclusions. These being that, there could be a threat of racism when it comes to finding jobs in NSW, since those who don't ot aren't good at english have lower incomes than those that are fluent in english. Another conclusion could be that higher income in NSW Australia require a certain comprehension of english, based on the facts provided.
  <br>
  <br>
    Regardless there is a clear visualisation of the 'latte line' when analysing these two datasets.
