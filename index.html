     <h2>Mesh Blocks & Statistical Area 1</h2>
     <h3>Mesh blocks are the smallest geographical area, that are merged together to form larger statistical regions such as Statistical Area 1's (SA1), which form the basis of the the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). Mesh blocks do not overlap or or have gaps in between them. In 2016, there were 358 122 mesh blocks that formed the ASGS. There are certain criterias that a mesh block must meet, these criterias change depending on the area the mesh block is located in. Mesh blocks are also mainly categorised by their land use. These categories include; Residential; Commercial; Industrial; Parkland; Education; Hospital/Medical; Transport; Primary Production; Water; and Other.
