     <h2>Mesh Blocks & Statistical Area 1</h2>
     <h3>Mesh blocks are the smallest geographical area, that are merged together to form larger statistical regions such as Statistical Area 1's (SA1), which form the basis of the the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). Mesh blocks do not overlap or or have gaps in between them. In 2016, there were 358 122 mesh blocks that formed the ASGS. There are certain criterias that a mesh block must meet, these criterias change depending on the area the mesh block is located in. Mesh blocks are also mainly categorised by their land use. These categories include; Residential; Commercial; Industrial; Parkland; Education; Hospital/Medical; Transport; Primary Production; Water; and Other.

       <br>
         Statistical Area 1's are geographical areas that are comprised of whole mesh blocks. Much like mesh blocks, SA1's are used to form SA2's and so on. SA1's are the smallest level at which the census data released. There are 57 523 SA1's that cover the entirety of Australia. SA1's are generally either urban or rural, SA1's have an average of 400 persons, having between approxiamately 200 to 800 people, urban SA1's have a higher population than rural SA1's. Similar to mesh blocks there is a criteria that is taken into account when creating or forming SA1's.

     <h2>Data Journalism</h2>
     <br>
     <br>
     <h3> Data Journalism is gathering information, usually statistical data, and writing a report about the findings made on the statistics used. Data journalism, usually uses infographics of the data, which help visualise the data in an eye catching way. A great example of data journalism is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-dangerous-jobs/">Bloomberg's The Deadliest Jobs in America</a>article. This article uses mainly graphs and images to convey the 'story' they are trying to convey.
